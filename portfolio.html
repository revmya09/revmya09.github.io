            <p><br>I was a project member on the 2022 HowdyHack hackathon team hosted by Texas A&M University. Our project, called Space Travelers, 
                is a side-scroll arcade-style game that utilizes the Pygame library within Python. The game has many features. These include a fully 
                functional UI, complete with a main menu, settings page, and pause menu, allowing the user full control of the game. Additionally, 
                this game features an AI-based player tracking system that adds a level of difficulty to the game with the meteors becoming faster 
                and more targeting towards the player as the user progresses through the game. And last, but certainly not least, Space Traveler 
                features a custom soundtrack!</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do">NGC Internship Project</a></h1>
            <p><br>During my summer internship with Northrop Grumman, I helped construct a lightweight, 
                extensible Python API that served as a cross-compiler within the company. Using my API, 
                users were able to input required artifacts, targets, toolchains, dependencies, and 
                program-specific build information. Then, the API sets up build configurations based 
                on these parameters and invokes a script that automatically generate a build recipe for 
                each configuration, such as Makefiles for Unix-based systems and VS projects for Windows systems.
                This allowed programs across the enterprise to utilize and extend common codebases for their 
                specific targets, reducing code redunancy while increasing overall efficiency and maintainability.</p>

            <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZY2e25VUw">Speedcubing Hub &lpar;FUTURE&rpar;</a></h1>
            <p><br>A project that I definitely want to take on in the future is creating a mobile or web-based application that acts as a one-stop 
                shop for all things speedcubing. Speedcubing is a sport that involves solving a variety of combination puzzles, such as a Rubik's Cube, 
                as fast as you can. This application would, in a sense, be a hub for speedcubing enthusiasts and feature various useful tools. For example, 
                a Timer that allows users to practice speedcubing and track their progress. This timer would keep track of all solves for all types of puzzles, 
                and provide statistics based on this data to the user. There would also be a Tutorial mode which allows newcomers to follow step by step 
                instructions to learn how to solve, say, a Rubik's Cube. Other capabilities would include a shop database that contains links to external 
                websites for users to purchase cubes. Ideally, the tech stack I would use for this project is HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the Frontend and Python/SQL for the backend.</p>
